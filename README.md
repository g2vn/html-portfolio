# Portfolio made completely with HTML
(I have plans to consistently update this with CSS and JS as I go.)

## Update 1:

- Added an HTML boilerplate to all webpages for better structure
- Added an HTML title for my webpages to have a proper tab title

## Update 1.1:

- In regards to [my Resume page](https://github.com/g2vn/html-resume), extended functionality has been added to go back to the Home page through links.
- Did the same thing as above, but for all child webpages
