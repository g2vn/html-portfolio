  <h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>

  <hr />

  <h3>Chronicle</h3>

  <p>A movie filled with supernatural phenomena, average writing and the impressive camera work takes it's place on my list <br>
  It's filled with some beautiful shots and steady color palette and a decent cast. <br>
  Though it's not seen as the best in a lot of eyes, the subject matter of powers used in this way is realistic and interesting <br>
  Bravo!</p>

  <h3>Everything Everywhere All At Once</h3>

  <p>Real themes, real people. <br>
  With a star-studded cast, an inventive director, artists perfection, this film embodies so much of what cinema is. <br>
  The colors pop, the actors are embedded int their ole, and best of all, the art and themes of the scenes are shockingly perfect. <br>
  One of the greatest films to grace our world, truly.</p>

  <h3>Soul</h3>

  <p>Soul. A movie that encapsulates the beautiful path of life and death, in the most comforting way yet. <br>
  Following the story of Joe Gardener, exploring death, life, blackness, passion, it's all very home-hitting. <br>
  this movies direction in terms of approach orally and artistically blew me away, and I actually cried watching this. <br>
  A beautiful film that has yet to be topped in my heart.</p>

  <h2>That's all. Thanks for reading!</h2>
