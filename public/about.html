  <h1>About Me</h1>

  <hr>

  <h2>Who am I?</h2>
  <p>I'm an aspiring web developer with a passion in UI/UX design, learning to craft beautiful, fluid websites and design attractive,
    gripping websites that can pull any user and client in. <br>
    With a heart for art, drive for coding and a love for tech, 
    combining the three most essential pieces of my life comes together in the form of chasing my career goal. <br>
    Join me as I venture deeper into the world of coding, design and web development.
  </p>

  <h2>What Have I Done?</h2>
  <p>I am a 20 year old attending the <a href ="https://www.uhd.edu/Pages/home.aspx">University of Houston-Downtown</a>, where I am reaching for a Bachelors in Computer Science, 
  with an outside focus on web development and design. <br>
  I've worked closely with rising Houston tech collective, <a href="https://iondistrict.com/">The Ion</a>, as a student ambassador, engaging in 
  various group sessions, trips and meetings to expand my knowledge of coding, marketing and networking all at once. <br>
  I also have been apart of on-campus groups, <a href="https://cahsi.utep.edu/">CAHSI</a> and <a href="https://uhd.campusgroups.com/acm/home/">ACM</a>, computing groups geared towards the development of 
  Computer Science students alike.
  </p>

  <h2>Growing up...</h2>
  <p>Tech was new and unraveling, and it fascinated me. I took Robotics in my middle school class and, needless to say, 
    it was eyeopening and I realized from a young age that I was fascinated with the industry and needed more. <br>
    Throughout the years I've garnered skills and am constantly making the push to increase my knowledge as a tech lover
    and as a programmer alike.</p>
